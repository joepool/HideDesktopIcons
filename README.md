# HideDesktopIcons
Simple macOS App to hide the desktop icons.   
This runs in the menu bar and has a simple dropdown menu where you can set the desktop icons visibility.  
I built this app as I frequently found my self wanting a clean desktop for taking screenshots etc. I also wanted to learn the basics of Xcode and Swift.  
 
## Installation
Download the DMG from the releases section of this repository and drag the app into your applications folder (The app will not work if it is not in the applications folder).    
Optionally add this to your login items so it automatically runs when you login.   
Tested and working on MacOS Catalina 10.15 and MacOS Big Sur 11.0
